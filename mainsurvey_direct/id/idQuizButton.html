<p>Several weeks ago, we conducted a survey with around 100 people where they completed a math test under a time limit. Each person was assigned a math score based on the number of questions they correctly answered. Each person was also assigned a randomly generated ID number. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The computer has randomly generated and selected 2 groups of ${e://Field/groupsize} people from this pool of people to match with you. Their math scores are also recorded. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> In Group A, ${e://Field/halfgroupsize} people have odd ID, and ${e://Field/halfgroupsize} people have even ID. In Group B, ${e://Field/numodd} people have odd ID, and ${e://Field/numeven} people have even ID. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> You are guaranteed a participation fee of $${e://Field/baseFee} when you complete the survey. You have the chance of earning a bonus of $${e://Field/bonusFee} based on your choices in this survey. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p> Your actual earnings will depend on your decisions in the questions. The more accurately you answer the questions, the higher your chance of earning the bonus is. </p>
