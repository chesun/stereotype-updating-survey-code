<p>In this question, you will be asked to choose between a list of uncertain options. Specifically, on every line, you will be asked to choose between:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Option A: </b> Earn $4 if the top scorer in the group has an odd ID.</li>
	<li><b>Option B: </b> Earn $4 if the number on the ball randomly drawn from Basket B is in the ranges indicated on the line.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are some reminders before you make your choices:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In this group that is paired with you, there are&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bolder;">${e://Field/numodd}</span>&nbsp;people with an odd participant ID, and&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bolder;">${e://Field/numeven}</span>&nbsp;people with an even participant ID.</li>
	<li><span style="text-align: center;">Basket B contains 100 balls numbered 1 to 100. Each number appears in the basket exactly once and all balls are equal likely to be drawn.</span></li>
</ul>
