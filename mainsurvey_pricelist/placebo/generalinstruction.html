<p>Several weeks ago, we conducted a survey with a group of 100 people who completed a math test with 20 questions under time-limit. The computer has randomly generated and selected a 20-person group from this pool of 100. Throughout this study, we would be referring to this same group in all of the questions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are <b> ${e://Field/nummen} </b> men and <b> ${e://Field/numwomen} </b> women in this group. In the group, <b> ${e://Field/numodd} </b> people&rsquo;s participant ID is an odd number, and <b> ${e://Field/numeven} </b> people&rsquo;s participant ID is an even number.</p>
