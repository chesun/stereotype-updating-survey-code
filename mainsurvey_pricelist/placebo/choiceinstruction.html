<p> In the next part of the experiment, you will face a series of questions in which you will be asked to choose between a list of uncertain options. Specifically, on every line, you will be asked to choose between:
  <ul>
    <li> <b> Option A: </b> Earn $4 if the score of the top odd-ID person is higher than the top even-ID person in the group. </li>
    <li> <b> Option B: </b> Earn $4 if the ball randomly drawn from Basket B is smaller than or equal to a certain number. </li>
  </ul>
</p>


<p> Basket B contains 100 balls numbered 1 to 100. Each number appears in the basket exactly once and all balls are equal likely to be drawn. </p>
